# nodejs-first-class-api

My experiments in building a first class REST API with node.js.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Just [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/); I generally use the LTS which is 8.10.0 at time of writing.

### Installing

Clone the repo and install dependencies

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rick-roche/nodejs-first-class-api.git
cd nodejs-first-class-api
npm i
```

## Running the tests

Two types of tests are included; unit tests (testing the internals) and end to end tests (testing the exposed interfaces)

### Unit tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example

### Linting 

The repo makes use of `tslint` and you can lint your code by running

```sh
npm run lint
```

## Deployment
